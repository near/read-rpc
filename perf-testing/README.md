# Performance test of Read RPC and Archival RPC

### Low load

```
Read RPC (success/total)	Archival RPC (success/total)
-------------------------------------------
628 ms (10/10)		518 ms (10/10)		cold chunks
642 ms (10/10)		383 ms (10/10)		hot chunks
-------------------------------------------
116 ms (17/17)		2211 ms (10/10)		cold transactions
141 ms (37/37)		3778 ms (39/39)		hot transactions
-------------------------------------------
283 ms (17/17)		2312 ms (10/10)		cold accounts
405 ms (37/37)		162 ms (39/39)		hot accounts
-------------------------------------------
1281 ms (9/9)		7333 ms (9/9)		cold function calls
1074 ms (9/9)		268 ms (9/9)		hot function calls
-------------------------------------------
```

### Higher load

```
Read RPC (success/total)	Archival RPC (success/total)
-------------------------------------------
763 ms (100/100)	2703 ms (99/100)	cold chunks
911 ms (100/100)	4723 ms (100/100)	hot chunks
-------------------------------------------
168 ms (146/146)	4784 ms (87/167)	cold transactions
475 ms (533/533)	∞ ms (0/590)		hot transactions
-------------------------------------------
341 ms (146/146)	32262 ms (166/167)	cold accounts
7285 ms (530/533)	51959 ms (150/590)	hot accounts
-------------------------------------------
4560 ms (99/99)		31069 ms (55/99)	cold function calls
3006 ms (99/99)		∞ ms (0/99)		hot function calls
```

### The goals of this repo is to:
- Know the estimate of how long does the real query execute
- See the difference between timings for "fresh" (last 5 epochs) and archival queries
- Compare Read RPC and Archival RPC
- Find the critical places in both solutions and prioritize improving them

### Things that weren't the goals:
- Make honest perf testing with millions of synthetic queries - reliability should be checked separately if needed
- Cover all the methods. I collected the stats about methods popularity and covered the most popular ones

## .env

```bash
READ_RPC_URL=https://your_read_rpc_url
NEAR_RPC_URL=http://your_near_rpc_url
QUERIES_COUNT_PER_COMMAND=30
```

Think twice while using `https://archival-rpc.mainnet.near.org` as the value for `NEAR_RPC_URL`, it's not one machine, it's a set of machines. Be sure what you are benchmarking.


`QUERIES_COUNT_PER_COMMAND` is the most interesting parameter. `30` is the default value, and it means that _around_ 30 queries will be done for each method, separately for archival (cold) and fresh (hot) part. The same queries are made simultaneously.  
If we put the value bigger than 100, it gives unbearable load for both solutions, and the numbers degrade sufficiently.

Also, check the region where you are running. If one service runs in Europe, and the other is in the US, it's better to run test twice from both regions and manually compare the results.
